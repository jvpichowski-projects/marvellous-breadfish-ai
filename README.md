# The Marvellous Breadfish AI

In 2015 we build a [competition-winning ai](https://github.com/jvpichowski-projects/cau_software_challenge_2015_submission) for solving the game "Hey, thanks for the fish!". 
This contest was hosted by the University Kiel.
After five years of absence, it is time to revive the project with an artificial intelligence-based on new concepts. 
Back in the days, we named our ai *Breadfish* after the song about the [marvellous breadfish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RpdPzJgaBw).
Now it is time to go to the next step and build the *Marvellous Breadfish AI*.

## Coming soon

Stay tuned for a new attempt on fishing on ice floes.
